# DiveForge Admin Dashboard - Post Installation

## What was created:

### 1. Controllers:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/DashboardController.php` - Main admin dashboard
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php` - User management
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/DiveShopController.php` - Dive shop management

### 2. Middleware:
- `app/Http/Middleware/EnsureUserIsAdmin.php` - Admin access protection

### 3. Views:
- `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php` - Admin layout template
- `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php` - Dashboard view
- `resources/views/admin/users/index.blade.php` - User listing

### 4. Routes:
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/users` - User management
- `/admin/shops` - Shop management

## Next Steps:

### 1. Complete the installation:
```bash
# If not already done, complete the installer
visit: http://your-domain.com/install
```

### 2. Create an admin user manually (if needed):
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
```php
$user = new App\Models\User();
$user->name = "Admin User";
$user->email = "admin@example.com";
$user->password = bcrypt("your-secure-password");
$user->is_admin = true;
$user->is_active = true;
$user->email_verified_at = now();
$user->save();
```

### 3. Access the admin dashboard:
- Login at: `/login`
- Admin dashboard: `/admin/dashboard`

### 4. Complete missing views:
You'll need to create these additional views:
- `resources/views/admin/users/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/users/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/users/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/shops/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/shops/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/shops/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/shops/show.blade.php`

### 5. Add the missing migration columns:
Make sure your users table has these columns (from the migration we created):
- `is_admin` (boolean)
- `is_active` (boolean)
- `phone` (string)
- `primary_shop_id` (foreign key)
- `total_dives` (integer)
- `certification_level` (string)

## Troubleshooting:

### If you get "Admin privileges required" error:
Run this command to make a user admin:
```bash
php artisan tinker
User::where('email', 'your-email@example.com')->update(['is_admin' => true]);
```

### If routes don't work:
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### If you get middleware errors:
Make sure `bootstrap/app.php` has the admin middleware registered.
